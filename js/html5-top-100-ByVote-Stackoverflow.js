Note the pseudo-elements act like real elements in the <a href=\"http://glazkov.com/2011/01/14/what-the-heck-is-shadow-dom/\">Shadow DOM</a>. A <code>padding</code> on an <code>input</code> will not get the same background color as the pseudo-element.</p>\n\n<h2>CSS selectors</h2>\n\n<p>User agents are required to ignore a rule with an unknown selector. See <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#Conformance\">Selectors Level 3</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#grouping\">group</a> of selectors containing an invalid selector is invalid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we need separate rules for each browser. Otherwise the whole group would be ignored by all browsers.\n</p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\">\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>::-webkit-input-placeholder { /* WebKit browsers */\n    color:    #909;\n}\n:-moz-placeholder { /* Mozilla Firefox 4 to 18 */\n   color:    #909;\n   opacity:  1;\n}\n::-moz-placeholder { /* Mozilla Firefox 19+ */\n   color:    #909;\n   opacity:  1;\n}\n:-ms-input-placeholder { /* Internet Explorer 10+ */\n   color:    #909;\n}</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;input placeholder=\"Stack Snippets are awesome!\"&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>Usage notes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Be careful to avoid bad contrasts. Firefox's placeholder appears to be defaulting with a reduced opacity, so needs to use <code>opacity: 1</code> here.</li>\n<li>Note that placeholder text is just cut off if it doesn’t fit – size your input elements in <code>em</code> and test them with big minimum font size settings. Don’t forget translations: some languages <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/International/articles/article-text-size.en\">need more room</a> for the same word. </li>\n<li>Browsers with HTML support for <code>placeholder</code> but without CSS support for that (like Opera) should be tested too.</li>\n<li>Some browsers use additional default CSS for some <code>input</code> types (<code>email</code>, <code>search</code>).

Use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/-moz-appearance\">properties</a> <code>-webkit-appearance</code> and <code>-moz-appearance</code> to change that.

Okay, here's my reasoning why I feel it really makes all sense in the world to know if a person is using an iPad mini or a 2. And do with my reasoning what you like.</p>\n\n<p>The iPad mini is not only a much smaller device (9.7 inch versus 7.9 inch), but its form factor allows for a different usage. The iPad 2 is usually held with two hands when gaming unless you're <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris_facts\">Chuck Norris</a>. The mini is smaller, but it is also much lighter and allows for gameplay where you hold it in one hand and use another to swipe or tap or whatnot. As a game designer and developer myself, I'd just like to <strong>know</strong> if it's a mini so I can choose to provide the player with a different controlscheme if I want (for instance after A/B testing with a group of players). </p>\n\n<p>Why? Well, it's a proven fact that the majority of users tend to go with the default settings, so leaving out a virtual thumbstick and putting some other tap-based control on the screen (just giving an arbitrary example here) when the player loads up the game for the first time is what I, and probably other game designers, would love to <strong>be able to</strong> do.</p>\n\n<p>So IMHO this goes beyond the thick fingers / guidelines discussions and is just something Apple and all other vendors ought to do: allow us to uniquely identify your device and <strong>think different</strong> instead of <strong>following</strong> guidelines.</p>\n    ",

    "a": "\n<p>Actually, you are quite right when it comes to header/footer.  Here is some basic information on how each of the major HTML5 tags can/should be used (I suggest reading the full source linked at the bottom): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>section</em></strong> – Used for grouping together thematically-related content. Sounds like a div element, but it’s not. The div has no semantic meaning. Before replacing all your div’s with section elements, always ask yourself: “Is all of the content related?”</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>aside</em></strong> – Used for tangentially related content. Just because some content appears to the left or right of the main content isn’t enough reason to use the aside element. Ask yourself if the content within the aside can be removed without reducing the meaning of the main content. Pullquotes are an example of tangentially related content.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>header</em></strong> – There is a crucial difference between the header element and the general accepted usage of header (or masthead). There’s usually only one header or ‘masthead’ in a page. In HTML5 you can have as many as you want. The spec defines it as “a group of introductory or navigational aids”. You can use a header in any section on your site. In fact, you probably should use a header within most of your sections. The spec describes the section element as “a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.”</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>nav</em></strong> – Intended for major navigation information. A group of links grouped together isn’t enough reason to use the nav element. Site-wide navigation, on the other hand belongs in a nav element.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>footer</em></strong> – Sounds like its a description of the position, but its not. Footer elements contain informations about its containing element: who wrote it, copyright, links to related content, etc. Whereas we usually have one footer for an entire document, HTML5 allows us to also have footer within sections.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.anthonycalzadilla.com/2010/08/html5-section-aside-header-nav-footer-elements-not-as-obvious-as-they-sound/\">http://www.anthonycalzadilla.com/2010/08/html5-section-aside-header-nav-footer-elements-not-as-obvious-as-they-sound/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n    "

Good question.</p>\n  \n  <p>One reason SSEs have been kept in the shadow is because later APIs like WebSockets provide a richer protocol to perform bi-directional, full-duplex communication. Having a two-way channel is more attractive for things like games, messaging apps, and for cases where you need near real-time updates in both directions. However, in some scenarios data doesn't need to be sent from the client. You simply need updates from some server action. A few examples would be friends' status updates, stock tickers, news feeds, or other automated data push mechanisms (e.g. updating a client-side Web SQL Database or IndexedDB object store). If you'll need to send data to a server, XMLHttpRequest is always a friend.</p>\n  \n  <p>SSEs are sent over traditional HTTP. That means they do not require a special protocol or server implementation to get working. WebSockets on the other hand, require full-duplex connections and new Web Socket servers to handle the protocol. In addition, Server-Sent Events have a variety of features that WebSockets lack by design such as automatic reconnection, event IDs, and the ability to send arbitrary events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>TLDR summary:</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Advantages of SSE over Websockets:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Transported over simple HTTP instead of a custom protocol</li>\n<li>Can be poly-filled with javascript to \"backport\" SSE to browsers that do not support it yet.</li>\n<li>Built in support for re-connection and event-id</li>\n<li>Simpler protocol</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Advantages of Websockets over SSE:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Real time, two directional communication.</li>\n<li>Native suport in more browers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideal use cases of SSE:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stock ticker streaming</li>\n<li>twitter feed updating</li>\n<li>Notifications to browser</li>\n</ul>\n    "

    "l": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1933969/sound-effects-in-javascript-html5",
    "q": "\n\n<p>I'm using HTML5 for its most noblest purpose: games, of course! The obstacle I've run into now is how to play sound effects.</p>\n\n<p>The game is a port of an old Macintosh game, and because of its age, the requirements are few in number:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Play and mix multiple sounds,</li>\n<li>Play the same sample multiple times, possibly overlapping playbacks</li>\n<li>Interrupt playback of a sample at any point</li>\n<li>Preferably play WAV files containing (low quality) raw PCM, but I can convert these, of course</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My first approach was to use the HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; element and define all sound effects in my page. Firefox plays the WAV files just peachy, but calling #play multiple times doesn't really play the sample multiple times. From my understanding of the HTML5 spec, the &lt;audio&gt; element also tracks playback state, so that explains why.</p>\n\n<p>My immediate thought was to clone the audio elements, so I created the following tiny javascript library to do that for me (depends on jquery):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Snd = {\n  init: function() {\n    $(\"audio\").each(function() {\n      var src = this.getAttribute('src');\n      if (src.substring(0, 4) !== \"snd/\") { return; }\n      // Cut out the basename (strip directory and extension)\n      var name = src.substring(4, src.length - 4);\n      // Create the helper function, which clones the audio object and plays it\n      var Constructor = function() {};\n      Constructor.prototype = this;\n      Snd[name] = function() {\n        var clone = new Constructor();\n        clone.play();\n        // Return the cloned element, so the caller can interrupt the sound effect\n        return clone;\n      };\n    });\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now I can do <em>Snd.boom();</em> from the Firebug console and play 'snd/boom.wav'. Neat. But I still can't play the same sample multiple times. It seems that the &lt;audio&gt; element is really more of a streaming feature rather than something to play sound effects with.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a clever way to make this happen that I'm missing?

The rows are still being added and removed as the user is scrolling, but the scrolling itself is done by the browser.  That allows it to be very fast yet smooth (onscroll events are notoriously slow).  The caveat is that there are bugs/limits in the browsers' CSS engines that limit the potential height of an element.  For IE, that happens to be 0x123456 or 1193046 pixels.  For other browsers it is higher.  </p>\n\n<p>There is an experimental workaround in the \"largenum-fix\" branch that raises that limit significantly by populating the scrollable area with \"pages\" set to 1M pixels height and then using relative positioning within those pages.  Since the height limit in the CSS engine seems to be different and significantly lower than in the actual layout engine, this gives us a much higher upper limit.</p>\n\n<p>I am still looking for a way to get to unlimited number of rows without giving up the performance edge that SlickGrid currently holds over other implementations.</p>\n\n<p>Rudiger, can you elaborate on how you solved this?</p>\n    "

You should read this answer even if you are using jQuery Mobile 1.4 +, it goes beyond page events so you will probably find a lot of useful information. </p>\n\n<h3>Older content:</h3>\n\n<p>This article can also be found as a part of my blog <strong><a href=\"http://www.gajotres.net/document-onpageinit-vs-document-ready/\">HERE</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<h1>$(document).on('pageinit') vs $(document).ready()</h1>\n\n<p>The first thing you learn in <strong>jQuery</strong> is to call code inside the <strong>$(document).ready()</strong> function so everything will execute as soon as the DOM is loaded. However, in <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong>, Ajax is used to load the contents of each page into the DOM as you navigate. Because of this <strong>$(document).ready()</strong> will trigger before your first page is loaded and every code intended for page manipulation will be executed after a page refresh. This can be a very subtle bug. On some systems it may appear that it works fine, but on others it may cause erratic, difficult to repeat weirdness to occur.</p>\n\n<p>Classic jQuery syntax:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() { \n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To solve this problem (and trust me this is a problem) <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> developers created page events. In a nutshell page events are events triggered in a particular point of page execution. One of those page events is a <strong>pageinit</strong> event and we can use it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on('pageinit', function() {\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can go even further and use a page id instead of document selector. Lets say we have jQuery Mobile page with an id <strong>index</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div data-role=\"page\" id=\"index\"&gt;\n    &lt;div data-theme=\"a\" data-role=\"header\"&gt;\n        &lt;h3&gt;\n            First Page\n        &lt;/h3&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#second\" class=\"ui-btn-right\"&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div data-role=\"content\"&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#\" data-role=\"button\" id=\"test-button\"&gt;Test button&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div data-theme=\"a\" data-role=\"footer\" data-position=\"fixed\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To execute a code that will only available to the index page we could use this syntax:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#index').on('pageinit', function() {\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Pageinit</strong> event will be executed every time page is about be be loaded and shown for the first time. It will not trigger again unless page is manually refreshed or ajax page loading is turned off. In case you want code to execute every time you visit a page it is better to use <strong>pagebeforeshow</strong> event.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a working example : <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/Q3Usv/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/Q3Usv/</a> to demonstrate this problem.</p>\n\n<p>Few more notes on this question. No matter if you are using 1 html multiple pages or multiple html files paradigm it is advised to separate all of your custom javascript page handling into a single separate js file. This will note make your code any better but you will have much better code overview, especially while creating a <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> application.</p>\n\n<p>There's also another special <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> event and it is called <strong>mobileinit</strong>.When <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> starts, it triggers a <strong>mobileinit</strong> event on the document object. To override default settings, bind them to <strong>mobileinit</strong>. One of a good examples of <strong>mobileinit</strong> usage is turning off ajax page loading, or changing default ajax loader behavior.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on(\"mobileinit\", function(){\n  //apply overrides here\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Page events transition order</h2>\n\n<p>First all events can be found here: <a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/events/\">http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/events/</a></p>\n\n<p>Lets say we have a page A and a page B, this is a unload/load order:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>page B - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagebeforecreate/\">pagebeforecreate</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page B - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecreate/\">pagecreate</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page B - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageinit/\">pageinit</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page A - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagebeforehide/\">pagebeforehide</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page A - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageremove/\">pageremove</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page A - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagehide/\">pagehide</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page B - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagebeforeshow/\">pagebeforeshow</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page B - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageshow/\">pageshow</a></strong></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>For better page events understanding read this:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>pagebeforeload</code></strong>, <strong><code>pageload</code></strong> and <strong><code>pageloadfailed</code></strong> are fired when an external page is loaded</li>\n<li><strong><code>pagebeforechange</code></strong>, <strong><code>pagechange</code></strong> and <strong><code>pagechangefailed</code></strong> are page change events.

Depending on how you managed to bind your events each time you visit some page it will bind events over and over. This is not an error, it is simply how <strong><code>jQuery Mobile</code></strong> handles its pages. For example, take a look at this code snipet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on('pagebeforeshow','#index' ,function(e,data){    \n    $(document).on('click', '#test-button',function(e) {\n        alert('Button click');\n    });    \n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Working jsFiddle example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/CCfL4/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/CCfL4/</a></p>\n\n<p>Each time you visit page <strong>#index</strong> click event will is going to be bound to button <strong>#test-button</strong>. Test it by moving from page 1 to page 2 and back several times. There are few ways to prevent this problem:</p>\n\n<h3>Solution 1</h3>\n\n<p>Best solution would be to use <strong><code>pageinit</code></strong> to bind events. If you take a look at an official documentation you will find out that <strong><code>pageinit</code></strong> will trigger ONLY once, just like document ready, so there's no way events will be bound again. This is best solution because you don't have processing overhead like when removing events with off method.</p>\n\n<p>Working jsFiddle example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/AAFH8/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/AAFH8/</a></p>\n\n<p>This working solution is made on a basis of a previous problematic example.</p>\n\n<h3>Solution 2</h3>\n\n<p>Remove event before you bind it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on('pagebeforeshow', '#index', function(){       \n    $(document).off('click', '#test-button').on('click', '#test-button',function(e) {\n        alert('Button click');\n    }); \n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Working jsFiddle example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/K8YmG/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/K8YmG/</a></p>\n\n<h3>Solution 3</h3>\n\n<p>Use a jQuery Filter selector, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#carousel div:Event(!click)').each(function(){\n    //If click is not bind to #carousel div do something\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Because event filter is not a part of official jQuery framework it can be found here:   <a href=\"http://www.codenothing.com/archives/2009/event-filter/\">http://www.codenothing.com/archives/2009/event-filter/</a></p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, if speed is your main concern then <strong>Solution 2</strong> is much better then Solution 1. </p>\n\n<h3>Solution 4</h3>\n\n<p>A new one, probably an easiest of them all.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on('pagebeforeshow', '#index', function(){       \n    $(document).on('click', '#test-button',function(e) {\n        if(e.handled !== true) // This will prevent event triggering more then once\n        {\n            alert('Clicked');\n            e.handled = true;\n        }\n    }); \n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Working jsFiddle example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/Yerv9/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/Yerv9/</a></p>\n\n<p>Tnx to the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/89789/sholsinger\">sholsinger</a> for this solution: <a href=\"http://sholsinger.com/archive/2011/08/prevent-jquery-live-handlers-from-firing-multiple-times/\">http://sholsinger.com/archive/2011/08/prevent-jquery-live-handlers-from-firing-multiple-times/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>pageChange event quirks - triggering twice</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes pagechange event can trigger twice and it does not have anything to do with the problem mentioned before.</p>\n\n<p>The reason the pagebeforechange event occurs twice is due to the recursive call in changePage when toPage is not a jQuery enhanced DOM object. This recursion is dangerous, as the developer is allowed to change the toPage within the event. If the developer consistently sets toPage to a string, within the pagebeforechange event handler, regardless of whether or not it was an object an infinite recursive loop will result. The pageload event passes the new page as the page property of the data object (This should be added to the documentation, it's not listed currently). The pageload event could therefore be used to access the loaded page.</p>\n\n<p>In few words this is happening because you are sending additional parameters through pageChange. </p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a data-role=\"button\" data-icon=\"arrow-r\" data-iconpos=\"right\" href=\"#care-plan-view?id=9e273f31-2672-47fd-9baa-6c35f093a800&amp;amp;name=Sat\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To fix this problem use any page event listed in <strong>Page events transition order</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Page Change Times</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned, when you change from one JQuery Mobile page to another, typically either through clicking on a link to another JQuery Mobile page that already exists in the DOM, or by manually calling $.mobile.changePage, several events and subsequent actions occur. At a high level the following actions occur:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A page change process is begun</li>\n<li>A new page is loaded</li>\n<li>The content for that page is “enhanced” (styled)</li>\n<li>A transition (slide/pop/etc) from the existing page to the new page occurs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a average page transition benchmark:</p>\n\n<p>Page load and processing: <strong>3ms</strong>\nPage enhance: <strong>45ms</strong>\nTransition: <strong>604ms</strong></p>\n\n<p>Total time: <strong>670ms</strong>   *These values are in milliseconds.</p>\n\n<p>So as you can see a transition event is eating almost 90% of execution time.</p>\n\n<h2>Data/Parameters manipulation between page transitions</h2>\n\n<p>It is possible to send a parameter/s from one page to another during page transition. It can be done in few ways.</p>\n\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/13932240/1848600\">http://stackoverflow.com/a/13932240/1848600</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 1:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can pass values with changePage:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.mobile.changePage('page2.html', { dataUrl : \"page2.html?paremeter=123\", data : { 'paremeter' : '123' }, reloadPage : true, changeHash : true });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And read them like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on('pagebeforeshow', \"#index\", function (event, data) {\n    var parameters = $(this).data(\"url\").split(\"?\")[1];;\n    parameter = parameters.replace(\"parameter=\",\"\");  \n    alert(parameter);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/15840673/1848600\">Example</a>:</h3>\n\n<p><strong>index.html</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n  &lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"widdiv=device-widdiv, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"http://www.dragan-gaic.info/js/jquery-1.8.2.min.js\"&gt;\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  \n    &lt;script&gt;\n        $(document).on('pagebeforeshow', \"#index\",function () {\n            $(document).on('click', \"#changePage\",function () {     \n                $.mobile.changePage('second.html', { dataUrl : \"second.html?paremeter=123\", data : { 'paremeter' : '123' }, reloadPage : false, changeHash : true });\n            }); \n        }); \n\n        $(document).on('pagebeforeshow', \"#second\",function () {\n            var parameters = $(this).data(\"url\").split(\"?\")[1];;\n            parameter = parameters.replace(\"parameter=\",\"\");  \n            alert(parameter);\n        });         \n    &lt;/script&gt;\n   &lt;/head&gt;\n   &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Home --&gt;\n    &lt;div data-role=\"page\" id=\"index\"&gt;\n        &lt;div data-role=\"header\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;\n                First Page\n            &lt;/h3&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div data-role=\"content\"&gt;\n          &lt;a data-role=\"button\" id=\"changePage\"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--content--&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--page--&gt;\n\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>second.html</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n  &lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"widdiv=device-widdiv, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"http://www.dragan-gaic.info/js/jquery-1.8.2.min.js\"&gt;\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  \n   &lt;/head&gt;\n   &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Home --&gt;\n    &lt;div data-role=\"page\" id=\"second\"&gt;\n        &lt;div data-role=\"header\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;\n                Second Page\n            &lt;/h3&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div data-role=\"content\"&gt;\n\n        &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--content--&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--page--&gt;\n\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Or you can create a persistent javascript object for a storage purpose.

It only works with HTML5 browsers (including Android and iOS browsers) but all stored data is persistent through page refresh.</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(typeof(Storage)!==\"undefined\") {\n    localStorage.firstname=\"Dragan\";\n    localStorage.lastname=\"Gaic\";            \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/J9NTr/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/J9NTr/</a></p>\n\n<p>Probably best solution but it will fail in some versions of iOS 5.X. It is a well know error.</p>\n\n<h2>Don’t Use .live() / .bind() /.delegate()</h2>\n\n<p>I forgot to mention (and tnx <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/64262/andleer\">andleer</a> for reminding me) use on/off for event binding/unbinding, live/die and bind/unbind are deprecated.</p>\n\n<p>The .live() method of jQuery was seen as a godsend when it was introduced to the API in version 1.3. In a typical jQuery app there can be a lot of DOM manipulation and it can become very tedious to hook and unhook as elements come and go. The .live() method made it possible to hook an event for the life of the app based on its selector. Great right? Wrong, the .live() method is extremely slow. The .live() method actually hooks its events to the document object, which means that the event must bubble up from the element that generated the event until it reaches the document. This can be amazingly time consuming.</p>\n\n<p>It is now deprecated. The folks on the jQuery team no longer recommend its use and neither do I. Even though it can be tedious to hook and unhook events, your code will be much faster without the .live() method than with it.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of <strong>.live()</strong> you should use <strong>.on()</strong>. <strong>.on()</strong> is about 2-3x faster then <strong>.live()</strong>. Take a look at this event binding benchmark: <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/jquery-live-vs-delegate-vs-on/34\">http://jsperf.com/jquery-live-vs-delegate-vs-on/34</a>, everything will be clear from there.</p>\n\n<h2>Benchmarking:</h2>\n\n<p>There's an excellent script made for <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> page events benchmarking. It can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tools/page-change-time.js\">https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tools/page-change-time.js</a>. But before you do anything with it I advise you to remove its <strong>alert</strong> notification system (each “change page” is going to show you this data by halting the app) and change it to <strong>console.log</strong> function.</p>\n\n<p>Basically this script will log all your page events and if you read this article carefully (page events descriptions) you will know how much time jQm spent of page enhancements, page transitions ....</p>\n\n<h2>Final notes</h2>\n\n<p>Always, and I mean always read official <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> documentation. It will usually provide you with needed information, and unlike some other documentation this one is rather good, with enough explanations and code examples.</p>\n\n<h2>Changes:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>30.01.2013 - Added a new method of multiple event triggering prevention </li>\n<li>31.01.2013 - Added a better clarification for chapter <strong>Data/Parameters manipulation between page transitions</strong></li>\n<li>03.02.2013 - Added new content/examples to the chapter <strong>Data/Parameters manipulation between page transitions</strong> </li>\n<li>22.05.2013 - Added a solution for page transition/change prevention and added links to the official page events API documentation</li>\n<li>18.05.2013 - Added another solution against multiple event binding</li>\n</ul>\n    "

    "q": "\n\n<p>What is the best approach for creating elements on the fly and being able to move them around? For example, let's say I want to create a rectangle, circle and polygon and then select those objects and move them around.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that HTML5 provides three elements that can make this possible: <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/embedded-content-0.html#svg\">svg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element\">canvas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/grouping-content.html#the-div-element\">div</a>. For what I want to do, which one of those elements will provide the best performance?</p>\n\n<p>To compare these approaches, I was thinking of creating three visually identical web pages that each have a header, footer, widget and text content in them. The widget in the first page would be created entirely with the <code>canvas</code> element, the second entirely with the <code>svg</code> element, and the third with the plain <code>div</code> element, HTML and CSS.</p>\n    ",
    "a": "\n<h2>The short answer:</h2>\n\n<p>SVG would be <em>easier</em> for you, since selection and moving it around is already built in. SVG objects are DOM objects, so they have \"click\" handlers, etc.</p>\n\n<p>DIVs are okay but clunky and have <em>awful</em> performance loading at large numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Canvas has the best performance hands-down, but you have to implement all concepts of managed state (object selection, etc) yourself, or use a library.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>The long answer:</h2>\n\n<p>HTML5 Canvas is simply a drawing surface for a bit-map. You set up to draw (Say with a color and line thickness), draw that thing, and then the Canvas has no knowledge of that thing: It doesn't know where it is or what it is that you've just drawn, it's just pixels. If you want to draw rectangles and have them move around or be selectable then you have to code all of that from scratch, <strong>including</strong> the code to remember that you drew them.</p>\n\n<p>SVG on the other hand must maintain references to each object that it renders. Every SVG/VML element you create is a real element in the DOM. By default this allows you to keep much better track of the elements you create and makes dealing with things like mouse events easier by default, but it slows down significantly when there are a large number of objects</p>\n\n<p>Those SVG DOM references mean that some of the footwork of dealing with the things you draw is done for you. And SVG is faster when rendering <em>really large</em> objects, but slower when rendering <em>many</em> objects.</p>\n\n<p>A game would probably be faster in Canvas. A huge map program would probably be faster in SVG. If you do want to use Canvas, I have some tutorials on getting movable objects up and running <a href=\"http://simonsarris.com/blog/510-making-html5-canvas-useful\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Canvas would be better for faster things and heavy bitmap manipulation (like animation), but will take more code if you want lots of interactivity.</p>\n\n<p>I've run a bunch of numbers on HTML DIV-made drawing versus Canvas-made drawing. I could make a huge post about the benefits of each, but I will give some of the relevant results of my tests to consider for your specific application:</p>\n\n<p>I made Canvas and HTML DIV test pages, both had movable \"nodes.\" Canvas nodes were objects I created and kept track of in Javascript. HTML nodes were movable Divs.</p>\n\n<p>I added 100,000 nodes to each of my two tests. They performed quite differently:</p>\n\n<p>The HTML test tab took forever to load (timed at slightly under 5 minutes, chrome asked to kill the page the first time). Chrome's task manager says that tab is taking up 168MB. It takes up 12-13% CPU time when I am looking at it, 0% when I am not looking.</p>\n\n<p>The Canvas tab loaded in one second and takes up 30MB. It also takes up 13% of CPU time all of the time, regardless of whether or not one is looking at it. <em>(2013 edit: They've mostly fixed that)</em></p>\n\n<p>Dragging on the HTML page is smoother, which is expected by the design, since the current setup is to redraw EVERYTHING every 30 milliseconds in the Canvas test. There are plenty of optimizations to be had for Canvas for this. (canvas invalidation being the easiest, also clipping regions, selective redrawing, etc.. just depends on how much you feel like implementing)</p>\n\n<p>There is no doubt you could get Canvas to be faster at object manipulation as the divs in that simple test, and of course far faster in the load time. Drawing/loading is faster in Canvas and has far more room for optimizations, too (ie, excluding things that are off-screen is very easy).</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SVG is probably better for applications and apps with few items (less than 1000? Depends really)</li>\n<li>Canvas is better for thousands of objects and careful manipulation, but a lot more code (or a library) is needed to get it off the ground.</li>\n<li>HTML Divs are clunky and do not scale, making a circle is only possible with rounded corners, making complex shapes is possible but involves hundreds of tiny tiny pixel-wide divs. Madness ensues.</li>\n</ul>\n    "

This 200x200 array is then passed to the client.</p>\n\n<p>The engine then determines the tiles from the values in the array and draws them to the canvas. So, I end up with interesting worlds that have realistic looking features: mountains, seas etc.</p>\n\n<p>Now the next thing I wanted to do was to apply some kind of blending algorithm that would cause tiles to seamlessly blend into their neighbours, <em>if</em> the neighbour is not of the same type. The example map above is what the player sees in their minimap. Onscreen they see a rendered version of the section marked by the white rectangle; where the tiles are rendered with their images rather than as single color pixels.</p>\n\n<p>This is an example of what the user would see in the map but <em>it is not the same location as the viewport above shows!</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/F0f9E.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>It is in this view that I want the transitioning to occur.</p>\n\n<h2>The Algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>I came up with a simple algorithm that would traverse the map within the viewport and render another image over the top of each tile, providing it was next to a tile of different type. (Not changing the map! Just rendering some extra images.) The idea of the algorithm was to profile the current tile's neighbors:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cetyi.png\" alt=\"An example of a tile profile\"></p>\n\n<p>This is an example scenario of what the engine might have to render, with the current tile being the one marked with the X.</p>\n\n<p>A 3x3 array is created and the values around it are read in. So for this example the array would look like.</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    [1,2,2]\n    [1,2,2]\n    [1,1,2]\n];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My idea was then to work out a series of cases for the possible tile configurations. On a very simple level:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(profile[0][1] != profile[1][1]){\n     //draw a tile which is half sand and half transparent\n     //Over the current tile -&gt; profile[1][1]\n     ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which gives this result:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/R4UPM.png\" alt=\"Result\"></p>\n\n<p>Which works as a transition from <code>[0][1]</code> to <code>[1][1]</code>, but not from <code>[1][1]</code> to <code>[2][1]</code>, where a hard edge remains. So I figured that in that instance a corner tile would have to be used. I created two 3x3 sprite sheets that I thought would hold all the possible combinations of tiles that could be needed. Then I replicated this for all of the tiles that there are in the game (The white areas are transparent). This ends up being 16 tiles for each type of tile (The center tiles on each spritesheet are not used.) </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4QXGR.png\" alt=\"Sand\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qKUwD.png\" alt=\"Sand2\"></p>\n\n<h2>The Ideal Outcome</h2>\n\n<p>So, with these new tiles and the correct algorithm, the example section would look like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SYNqQ.png\" alt=\"Correct\"></p>\n\n<p>Every attempt I have made has failed though, there is always some flaw in the algorithm and the patterns end up strange. I can't seem to get all the cases right and overall it seems like a poor way of doing it.</p>\n\n<h2>A Solution?</h2>\n\n<p>So, if anyone could provide an alternative solution as to how I could create this effect, or what direction to go for writing the profiling algorithm, then I would be very grateful!</p>\n    ",
    "a": "\n<p>The basic idea of this algorithm is to use a pre-processing step to find all edges and then select the correct smoothing tile according to the shape of the edge.</p>\n\n<p>The first step would be to find all edges. In the example below the <em>edge tiles</em> marked with an X are all green tiles with a tan tile as one or more of their eight neighbouring tiles. With different types of terrain this condition could translate to a tile being an edge tile if it has neighbours of lower terrain-number.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/X4Kyx.png\" alt=\"Edge tiles.\"></p>\n\n<p>Once all edge tiles are detected the next thing to do is to select the right smoothing tile for each edge tile. Here is my representation of your smoothing tiles.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0VXxS.png\" alt=\"Smoothing tiles.\"></p>\n\n<p>Note that there are actually not that many different types of tiles. We need the eight outer tiles from one of the 3x3 squares but only the four corner squares from the other since the straight-edge tiles are already found in the first square. This means that there in total are 12 different cases we must distinguish between.</p>\n\n<p>Now, looking at one edge tile we can determine which way the boundary turns by looking at its four closest neighbour tiles. Marking an edge tile with X just as above we have the following six different cases.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/BRgLf.png\" alt=\"Six cases.\"></p>\n\n<p>These cases are used to determine the corresponding smoothing tile and we can number the smoothing tiles accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qGuxN.png\" alt=\"Smoothed tiles with numbers.\"></p>\n\n<p>There is still a choice of a or b for each case. This depends on which side the grass is on. One way to determine this could be to keep track of the orientation of the boundary but probably the simplest way to do it is to pick one tile next to the edge and see what colour it has. The image below shows the two cases 5a) and 5b) which can be distinguished between by for example checking the colour of the top right tile.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3sgIZ.png\" alt=\"Choosing 5a or 5b.\"> </p>\n\n<p>The final enumeration for the original example would then look like this.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oniTS.png\" alt=\"Final enumeration.\"></p>\n\n<p>And after selecting the corresponding edge tile the border would look something like this.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fYBDR.png\" alt=\"Final result.\"></p>\n\n<p>As a final note I might say that this would work as long as the boundary is somewhat regular. More precisely, edge tiles that do not have exactly two edge tiles as their neighbours will have to be treated separately. This will occur for edge tiles on the edge of the map which will have a single edge neighbour and for very narrow pieces of terrain where the number of neighbouring edge tiles could be three or even four.</p>\n    "

It requires very little to get started and coding is fairly straight forward. It uses CSS classes for detecting the appropriate animations and interactions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sencha Touch:</strong><br>\n<em>almost <strong>completely</strong> JavaScript, GPL not for use on commercial sites without a license</em><br>\nIf you are building a complex enterprise application with a lot of visual interactions, I would strongly recommend Sencha Touch, it is heavily documented, with a strong professional team providing support. </p>\n\n<p><strong>M-Project:</strong><br>\n<em>MIT license, heavy on the JavaScript, appears to be in Alpha, may be buggy</em><br>\nAlthough I have never worked with M-Project myself (thanks for pointing it out) it does appear to be a very robust, and the coding style appears to be very similar to Sencha Touch, which is based on ExtJS, so if your team already has experience with ExtJS, it might be wise to consider one of these frameworks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nimblekit:</strong><br>\nThis appears to be for iOS only, not a good thing if you ever decide to expand your application to Android or some other platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wink Toolkit:</strong><br>\n<em>appears to be MIT, or some variation there of</em>\nIn my opinion, wink seems to have plenty going for it, but the documentation feels cold</p>\n\n<p><strong>jQuery Mobile:</strong><br>\n<em>Dual license MIT or GPL 2, just the right mixture of JavaScript and CSS</em><br>\nI will let someone with more experience talk about the merits, but jQuery mobile (though it is in alpha as well) is backed by a strong team and a community of supporters by extension of the core jQuery library. Probably the best choice for anything except the most enterprise centric applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Titanium:</strong><br>\n<em>Titanium is not an HTML5 mobile framework, it is a javascript based interface to native code modules included in the framework.

There are those that suggest that HTML5 will one day supplant/replace Adobe Flash.</p>\n\n<p><em>I do not develop software that runs in a browser,</em> so my (limited) understanding is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>HTML is a pure-text markup language that is delivered over HTTP to a client browser.  The client browser interprets the markup and renders (with varying degrees of success) the page according to an standard specification.</li>\n<li>Adobe Flash is a propriety framework for working with audio, video, sound and raster/vector graphics.  It requires special authoring tools (a compiler perhaps?) and a custom player that's available as a plug-in to most common browsers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Could someone please explain (to this C/C++ developer) how it is possible <em>from a technical/coding point-of-view</em> that a text-based markup language (HTML5) could be considered a replacement to a multimedia framework (Flash)? </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Please no opinionated arguments - just technical facts.</strong></em></p>\n    ",

An example is the HTML5 version of Youtube, recently introduced as beta for Safari/Chrome users, see <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/html5\">here</a>.

    "q": "\n\n<p>Seems like the new <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag is all the hype these days, especially since Firefox now supports it. News of this are popping up in blogs all over the place, and everyone seems to be excited. But what about?</p>\n\n<p>As much as I searched I could not find anything that would make it better than the good old Flash video. In fact, I see only problems with it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It will still be some time before all the browsers start supporting it, and much more time before most people upgrade;</li>\n<li>Flash is available already and everyone has it;</li>\n<li>You can couple Flash with whatever fancy UI you want for controlling the playback. I gather that the  tag will be controllable as well (via JavaScript probably), but will it be able to go fullscreen?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The only two pros for a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag that I can see are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is more \"semantic\" - which probably holds no importance to a whole lot of people, including me;</li>\n<li>It is not dependent on a single commercial 3rd party entity (Adobe) - which I also don't see as a compelling reason to switch, because free players and video converters are already available, and Adobe is not hindering the whole process in any way (it's not in their interests even).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So... what's the big deal?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>\n\n<p>OK, so there is one more Pro... maybe. Support for mobile devices. Hard to say though. A number of thoughts race through my head about the subject:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How many mobile devices are actually able to decode video at a decent speed anyway, Flash or otherwise?</li>\n<li>How long until mainstream mobile devices get the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> support? Even if it is available through updates, how many people actually do that?</li>\n<li>How many people watch videos on web pages on their mobile phones at all?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As for the semantics part - I understand that search engines might be able to detect videos better now, but... what will they do with them anyway? OK, so they know that there is a video in the page. And? They can't index a video! I'd like some more arguments here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just thought of another Cons. This opens up a whole new area of cross-browser incompatibility. HTML and CSS is quite messy already in this aspect. Flash at least is the same everywhere. But it's enough for at least one major browser vendor to decide against the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag (can anyone say \"Internet Explorer\"?) and we have a nice new area of hell to explore.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>\n\n<p>A Pro just came in. More competition = more innovation. That's true. Giving Adobe more competition will probably force them to improve Flash in areas it has been lacking so far. Linux seems to be a weak spot for it, cited by many.</p>\n    ",
    "a": "\n<p>There are many good points here, and like a Martial Arts fighting style, each point has its thrust, and each can be defended; but each can be defeated with the proper moves. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone standing on arguments about \"propietary\" plugins will fall quickly. Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe all bear the guilt, but that's just BUSINESS. You won't change business overnight, and each layer of complexity added by a new tag such as &lt;video&gt;  which supports a very technical interface will result in * slightly * different implementations by each browser. </p>\n\n<p>HTML 5 works now, and so does Flash. <strong>How</strong> it is implemented, the skill it requires- this defines each resource, whether it's an employee's performance, a webmaster's power, or a domain's influence. </p>\n\n<p>Although I'm only 40, I began programming when orange or green monochrome monitors were the color choice, and hardware installation came with prayer books instead of instruction manuals. Maybe you could figure out AT commands for the modem when it wouldn't configure with your hardware, and 64K RAM was like, WOWWWWW!</p>\n\n<p>HTML 5/Flash is a minor nuisance compared to that crap. Let's all learn how to collaborate in community toward a better resource. There is an Open Source Flash Project, it will have bugs. So will HTML 5...</p>\n\n<p>Every argument here is true, but not necessarily productive. Use that energy toward a solution.  </p>\n    "

Or is HTML5 WS supposed to take over in general?</p>\n    ",
    "a": "\n<p>WebSockets - is definitely the future.\nLong polling is dirty workaround of preventing creating connections for each request like AJAX does -- but long polling was created when WebSockets didn't exist. Now due to WebSockets, \nLong Polling is going away. And WebRTC allows peer-to-peer communication.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend learning <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets\">WebSockets</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Comparison:</h1>\n\n<p><em>of different communication techniques in web</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>AJAX</strong> - <code>request</code> → <code>response</code>. Creates connection to server, sends request headers with optional data, gets response from server, closes connection. <em>Supported in all major browsers.</em></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Long poll</strong> - <code>request</code> → <code>wait</code> → <code>response</code>. Creates connection to server like AJAX does, but keep-alive connection open for some time (not long though), during connection open client can receive data from server. Client have to reconnect periodically after connection is closed due to timeouts or data eof. On server side it is still treated like HTTP request same as AJAX, except the answer on request will happen now or some time in the future defined by application logic. <em>Supported in all major browsers.</em></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>WebSockets</strong> - <code>client</code> ↔ <code>server</code>. Create TCP connection to server, and keep it as long as needed. Server or client can easily close it. Client goes through HTTP compatible handshake process, if it succeeds, then server and client can exchange data both directions at any time. It is very efficient if application requires frequent data exchange in both ways. WebSockets do have data framing that includes masking for each message sent from client to server so data is simply encrypted. <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets\"><em>support chart</em></a> <em>(very good)</em></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>WebRTC</strong> - <code>peer</code> ↔ <code>peer</code>. Transport to establish communication between clients and is transport-agnostic so uses UDP, TCP or even more abstract layers. By design it allows to transport data in reliable as well as unreliable ways. This is generally used for high volume data transfer such as video/audio streaming where reliability - is secondary and few frames or reduction in quality progression can be sacrificed in favour of response time and at least delivering something. Both sides (peers) can push data to each other independently. While it can be used totally independent from any centralised servers it still require some way of exchanging endPoints data, where in most cases developers still use centralised servers to \"link\" peers. This is required only to exchange essential data for connection establishing - after connection is established server on aside is not required. <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=webrtc\"><em>support chart</em></a> <em>(medium)</em></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Server-Sent Events</strong> - <code>client</code> ← <code>server</code>. Client establishes persistent and long-term connection to server. Only server can send data to client. If client wants to send data to server it would require to use other technology/protocol to do so. This protocol is HTTP compatible and simple to implement in most server-side platforms. This is preferable protocol to be used instead of Long Polling. <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=eventsource\"><em>support chart</em></a> <em>(good, except IE)</em></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Advantages:</h2>\n\n<p>Main advantage of <strong>WebSockets</strong> for server, is that it is not HTTP request (after handshake), but proper message based communication protocol. That <strong>allows you to achieve huge performance and architecture advantages</strong>. For example in node.js you can share the same memory for different socket connections, so that way they can access shared variables. So you don't need to use database as exchange point in the middle (like with AJAX or Long Polling and for example PHP).\nYou can store data in RAM, or even republish between sockets straight away.</p>\n\n<h2>Security considerations</h2>\n\n<p>People often are concerned regarding security of WebSockets. Reality is that it makes little difference or even puts WebSockets as better option. First of all with AJAX there is a higher chance of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">MITM</a> as each request is new TCP connection and traversing through internet infrastructure. With WebSockets, once it's connected it is far more challenging to intercept in between, with additionally enforced frame masking when data is streamed from client to server as well as additional compression, that requires more effort to probe data. <strong>All modern protocols support both: HTTP and HTTPS (encrypted).</strong></p>\n\n<h2>P.S.</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Remember that WebSockets generally have a very different approach of logic for networking</strong>, more like real-time games had all this time, and not like http.</p>\n    "

    "a": "\n<p>When you pass a markup string into <code>$</code>, it's parsed as HTML using the browser's <code>innerHTML</code> property on a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> (or other suitable container for special cases like <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>). <code>innerHTML</code> can't parse SVG or other non-HTML content, and even if it could it wouldn't be able to tell that <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> was supposed to be in the SVG namespace.</p>\n\n<p><code>innerHTML</code> is not available on SVGElement—it is a property of HTMLElement only. Neither is there currently an <code>innerSVG</code> property or other way(*) to parse content into an SVGElement. For this reason you should use DOM-style methods. jQuery doesn't give you easy access to the namespaced methods needed to create SVG elements. Really jQuery isn't designed for use with SVG at all and many operations may fail.</p>\n\n<p>HTML5 promises to let you use <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> without an <code>xmlns</code> inside a plain HTML (<code>text/html</code>) document in the future. But this is just a parser hack(**), the SVG content will still be SVGElements in the SVG namespace, and not HTMLElements, so you'll not be able to use <code>innerHTML</code> even though they <em>look</em> like part of an HTML document.</p>\n\n<p>However, for today's browsers you must use *X*HTML (properly served as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>; save with the .xhtml file extension for local testing) to get SVG to work at all. (It kind of makes sense to anyway; SVG is a properly XML-based standard.) This means you'd have to escape the <code>&lt;</code> symbols inside your script block (or enclose in a CDATA section), and include the XHTML <code>xmlns</code> declaration. example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"&gt;&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;svg id=\"s\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"/&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n        function makeSVG(tag, attrs) {\n            var el= document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', tag);\n            for (var k in attrs)\n                el.setAttribute(k, attrs[k]);\n            return el;\n        }\n\n        var circle= makeSVG('circle', {cx: 100, cy: 50, r:40, stroke: 'black', 'stroke-width': 2, fill: 'red'});\n        document.getElementById('s').appendChild(circle);\n        circle.onmousedown= function() {\n            alert('hello');\n        };\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>*: well, there's DOM Level 3 LS's <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-LS/load-save.html#LS-LSParser-parseWithContext\">parseWithContext</a>, but browser support is very poor. Edit to add: however, whilst you can't inject markup into an SVGElement, you could inject a new SVGElement into an HTMLElement using <code>innerHTML</code>, then transfer it to the desired target. It'll likely be a bit slower though:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[\n    function parseSVG(s) {\n        var div= document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml', 'div');\n        div.innerHTML= '&lt;svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"&gt;'+s+'&lt;/svg&gt;';\n        var frag= document.createDocumentFragment();\n        while (div.firstChild.firstChild)\n            frag.appendChild(div.firstChild.firstChild);\n        return frag;\n    }\n\n    document.getElementById('s').appendChild(parseSVG(\n        '&lt;circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"50\" r=\"40\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"red\" onmousedown=\"alert(\\'hello\\');\"/&gt;'\n    ));\n]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>**: I hate the way the authors of HTML5 seem to be scared of XML and determined to shoehorn XML-based features into the crufty mess that is HTML.

Instead, it uses a new HTML5 feature, currently only supported in the above listed cases, called NavigationTiming. </p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: This is now supported in <a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/09/whats-new-for-web-developers-in-firefox-7/\">Firefox 7</a></p>\n\n<p>(Important to note that it doesn't run on every load; instead, it currently samples around 2% of pageviews, though it is configured to <em>try</em> to track all page loads on 10% of visits; as more browsers support the NavigationTiming API, you can expect the total sampled percentage to begin to get closer to 10%.)</p>\n\n<p>This interface is accessed under the DOM object <code>window.performance</code> (or, in earlier versions of Chrome, <code>window.webkitPerformance</code>), using the <code>timing</code> attribute (so, <code>window.performance.timing</code>).

    "q": "\n\n<p>What are the key differences between <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/\">HTML4</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/\">HTML5 draft</a>?</p>\n\n<p>Please keep the answers related to changed syntax and added/removed html elements.</p>\n    ",
    "a": "\n<p>HTML5 has several goals which differentiate it from HTML4.</p>\n\n<h1>Consistency in Handling Malformed Documents</h1>\n\n<p>The primary one is <em>consistent, defined error handling</em>.  As you know, HTML purposely supports 'tag soup', or the ability to write malformed code and have it corrected into a valid document.  The problem is that the rules for doing this aren't written down anywhere.  When a new browser vendor wants to enter the market, they just have to test malformed documents in various browsers (especially IE) and reverse-engineer their error handling.  If they don't, then many pages won't display correctly (estimates place roughly 90% of pages on the net as being at least somewhat malformed).</p>\n\n<p>So, HTML5 is attempting to discover and codify this error handling, so that browser developers can all standardize and greatly reduce the time and money required to display things consistently.  As well, long in the future after HTML has died as a document format, historians may still want to read our documents, and having a completely defined parsing algorithm will greatly aid this.</p>\n\n<h1>Better Web Application Features</h1>\n\n<p>The secondary goal of HTML5 is to develop the ability of the browser to be an application platform, via HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Many elements have been added directly to the language that are currently (in HTML4) Flash or JS-based hacks, such as <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>.  Useful things such as Local Storage (a js-accessible browser-built-in key-value database, for storing information beyond what cookies can hold), new input types such as date for which the browser can expose easy user interface (so that we don't have to use our js-based calendar date-pickers), and browser-supported form validation will make developing web applications much simpler for the developers, and make them much faster for the users (since many things will be supported natively, rather than hacked in via javascript).</p>\n\n<h1>Improved Element Semantics</h1>\n\n<p>There are many other smaller efforts taking place in HTML5, such as better-defined semantic roles for existing elements (<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> now actually mean something different, and even <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> have vague semantics that should work well when parsing legacy documents) and adding new elements with useful semantics - <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> should replace the majority of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s used on a web page, making your pages a bit more semantic, but more importantly, <em>easier to read</em>.  No more painful scanning to see just what that random <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> is closing - instead you'll have an obvious <code>&lt;/header&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;/article&gt;</code>, making the structure of your document much more intuitive.</p>\n    "
